# Project Brief: SkyGuard-Scheduler

## Project Identity
- **Project Name:** SkyGuard-Scheduler (Flight Schedule Pro)
- **Organization:** Flight Schedule Pro
- **Category:** AI Solution
- **Estimated Timeline:** 3-5 days
- **Status:** Production Ready (73% - 22 of 30 PRs completed: 17 original + 3 flight history PRs + 2 weather briefing PRs, with 5 new feature PRs + 3 deployment PRs remaining)

## Core Mission
Build an intelligent, automated system that monitors weather conditions for scheduled flight lessons, detects conflicts based on student training levels, and uses AI to suggest optimal rescheduling options. The system must provide real-time notifications and maintain a comprehensive dashboard for all stakeholders.

## Primary Goals

### Functional Objectives
1. **Automate Weather Monitoring** - Continuous hourly checks of weather at departure, destination, and flight corridor locations
2. **Intelligent Conflict Detection** - Apply training-level-specific weather minimums to determine flight safety
3. **Real-Time Notifications** - Multi-channel alerts (email + in-app) to students and instructors
4. **AI-Powered Rescheduling** - Generate 3 optimal reschedule options considering multiple factors
5. **Comprehensive Tracking** - Log all bookings, cancellations, and reschedules for analytics
6. **Dashboard Visualization** - Real-time display of alerts, flight statuses, and metrics

### Technical Objectives
- Build event-driven notification and scheduling system
- Integrate real-time weather data APIs (OpenWeatherMap)
- Implement AI reasoning using Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI
- Design normalized database schemas for flight scheduling
- Create role-based access control (Student, Instructor, Admin)

## Success Criteria

The project is successful when:
- ✅ Weather conflicts are automatically and accurately detected
- ✅ Notifications are successfully sent to all affected parties
- ✅ AI generates at least 3 valid reschedule options
- ✅ Database accurately updates bookings and logs all actions
- ✅ Dashboard displays live weather alerts and flight statuses
- ✅ AI logic correctly applies training-level-specific weather minimums

## Key Constraints
- Must support demo mode with 5 pre-built weather scenarios for testing
- Must handle three training levels with different weather minimums
- Must provide role-based dashboards (Student/Instructor/Admin)
- Must be deployable to AWS (or Azure/GCP)
- Must include comprehensive documentation and demo video

## Deliverables
1. **GitHub Repository** - Clean, well-documented codebase
2. **README** - Complete setup and usage instructions
3. **.env.template** - Environment variable documentation
4. **Demo Video** - 5-10 minute walkthrough of core features
5. **Production Deployment** - Working system on AWS
